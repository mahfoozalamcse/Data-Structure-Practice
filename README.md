chapter 1 : Tree Data Structure 

BinaryTreeCreate.java - Create tree and print traversal all way other basic operation

DeleteBST.java – Deletion operation in a Binary Search Tree (BST).

DeleteBinaryTree.java – Code for deleting an entire binary tree.

DeleteForest.java – Solve the LeetCode 1110: Delete Nodes and Return Forest problem.

DeleteHalfNode.java – Remove nodes having only one child in a tree.

DeleteLeaf.java – Delete all leaf nodes from a binary tree.

DeleteLinkedListMiddle.java – Delete the middle node of a linked list.

DeleteNthNode.java – Delete the N-th node during inorder traversal.

DeletePathlessK.java – Delete paths shorter than k in a binary tree.

DeleteSmallerandGreater.java – Keep nodes only within a given range by removing smaller/greater elements.

DeleteTree.java – Practice deleting a tree step by step.

DepthTree.java – Calculate tree depth and print k distance nodes using DFS and BFS.

InsertionTree.java – Insert operation in a Binary Tree.

LevelOrder.java – Perform level-order traversal; also find min, max, and size of the tree.

PrintInorderIterative.java – Iterative inorder, preorder, and diameter of the tree; also find LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor).
